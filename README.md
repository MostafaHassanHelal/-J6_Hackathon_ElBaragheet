# -Problem Statment
the idea: 
For helping blind people to know who is behind their doors.

# -Solution
By taking a photo of faces of people (behind the door) and trying to recognize those people and saying their names (e.g. Muhannad behind the door) and if there is a stranger then it will say it’s a stranger so that the user (a blind person) could take care. then ask the user to write her/his name and then the program will add her/his name with her/his photo to database of known people so that the app could recognize her/him next time.
